# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network model and optimizing it

## Overview of the analysis:

Using my knowledge from machine learning and neural networks for this project I use the features in this dataset I create a binary classifier that will tell the customer whether or not the applicants will be successful using alphabet soup. The dataset contains over 34,000 organizations that have been funded by alphabet soup. There are a number of columns that capture the metadata of each organization such as organization type, the use of funding amongst others. This project is comprised of 3 steps: Preprocessing the data for the neural network, Compile,train and evaluate the model & finally optimizing the model.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
